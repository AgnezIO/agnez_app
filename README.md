# Agnez, the eye inside the box

Need an app to visualize your machine learning algorithms? You came to the
right place.

### Example
Check this [demo](http://agnez.herokuapp.com) and its [code](https://github.com/AgnezIO/agnez/blob/master/examples/DRAW_agnez.ipynb). 

### Install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AgnezIO/agnez_app.git
cd agnez_app
make
```

### Usage
```shell
coffee app.coffee
```
Send beautiful visualization to the app and check the results on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you are a Keras user, you can do
that using [callbacks](https://github.com/AgnezIO/agnez_app.git).

Torch callbacks are coming soon.
